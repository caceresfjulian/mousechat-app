# MouseChat - Live Chat App using the MERN stack, Figma and Socket.io

## What's this all about?

First of all, welcome! Greetings from Colombia. This personal project is part of my <b> MERN </b> stack
portfolio (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJs). For the UI design, background images,
logos and visual identity in general, I used <b> Figma </b>, <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> and <b>Photoshop</b>. The authentication process was done using the <b>JSON Web Token technology</b> and <b>cookies</b>.
<br/><h1>Deployed project:</h1> https://mousechat-app.netlify.app/
<br>FYI, the frontend was deployed on <b>Netlify</b> and the backend on <b>Heroku</b>. Feel free to message me through the contact form over the website.
