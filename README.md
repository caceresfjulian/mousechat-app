# MouseChat - Live Chat App using the MERN stack, Figma and Socket.io

## What's this all about?

First of all, welcome! Greetings from Colombia. This personal project is part of my <b>MERN</b> stack
portfolio (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJs). For the UI design, background images,
logos and visual identity in general, I used <b> Figma </b>, <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> and <b>Photoshop</b>. The authentication process was done using the <b>JSON Web Token technology</b> and <b>cookies</b>.

### Deployed project:

<br>FYI, the frontend was deployed on <b>Netlify</b> and the backend on <b>Heroku</b>. Feel free to message me through the contact form over the website.

## Why these project and technologies?

The MERN stack is one of the hottest stacks nowdays. It allows you to build your whole project without using
nothing more than just Javascript. That's amazing! Also, there's a huge need for web developers out there with great comprehension on the whole process, disregarding if you're a front-end or back-end focused professional. So, as a personal project, it's a great opportunity to get a wider perspective and even work on your UI designing skills.

## Challenges and more!

After learning React's basics, it's normal to get ambicious and look for bigger projects. MouseChat was that kind of project for me. I built it from scratch with just some ideas written down. Personally, the deployment wasn't a piece of cake; the cookies set up and CORS gave me a headache. In the future, i'd love to build this service once again with React Native or implement a videochat service between users.
