A good README helps your projects stand out from a bunch of other projects. It should be as good as the project itself.
It is the first file a person will see when they encounter your project, so it should be fairly brief but detailed.
It will help you focus on what your project needs to deliver and how.

What was your motivation?
Why did you build this project?
What problem does it solve?
What did you learn?
What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.
